# Unit-Converter
Simple unit converter in C#

This code allows the user to input a value and input units, and then converts that value to an output unit also entered by the user. 
This code only handles a few units (meters, centimeters, and kilometers) but can be expanded by adding additional switch cases and introducing new units.
